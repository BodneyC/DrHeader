# Welcome to drHEADer

There are a number of HTTP headers which enhance the security of a website when used. Often ignored, or unknown, these HTTP security headers help prevent common web application vulnerabilities when used. 

DrHEADer helps with the audit of security headers received in response to a single request or a list of requests. 

When combined with the OWASP [Application Security Verification Standard](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS/blob/master/4.0/en/0x22-V14-Config.md) (ASVS) 4.0, it is a useful tool to include as part of an automated CI/CD pipeline which checks for missing HTTP headers. 

# How Do I Install It?

Easiest way to install drHEADer is to clone this repository and via a terminal window, run the following command:


``` console
$ python setup.py install
```
This will install all the pre-requisites and you'll end up with a drheader executable.


# How Do I Use It?

There are two ways you could use drHEADer, depending on what you want to achieve. The easiest way is using the CLI.

## CLI

drHEADer can perform a single scan against a target and report back which headers are present, like so:

``` console
$ drheader scan single https://santander.co.uk
```

If you wish to scan multiple sites, you'll need the targets in a JSON format, or a txt file, like so:

``` 
          [
            {
              "url": "https://example.com",
              "params": {
                  "example_parameter_key": "example_parameter_value"
              }
            },
            ...
          ]
```

For txt files, use the following command:

``` console
$ drheader scan bulk -ff targets.txt
```

There are a number of parameters you can specify during bulk scans, these are:

  -p, --post                     Use a post request to obtain headers
  --json                         Output report as json
  --debug                        Show error messages
  --rules FILENAME               Use custom rule set
  --help                         Show this message and exit.

To save scan results, you can use the --json parameter and pipe it to [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/), which is a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor,like so:

``` console
$ drheader scan single https://santander.co.uk --json | jq '.'
```

## In a Project

It is also possible to call drHEADer from within an existing project, and this is achieved like so:
    
    from drheader import Drheader
    
    # create drheader instance
    drheader_instance = Drheader(headers={'X-XSS-Protection': '1; mode=block'}, status_code=200)
    
    report = drheader_instance.analyze()
    print(report)

As we continue development on drHEADer, we will further enhance this functionality. 

## Roadmap

We have a lot of ideas for drHEADer, and will push often as a result. Some of the things you'll see shortly are:

* Building on the Python library to make it easier to embed in your own projects. 
* Releasing the API, which is seperate from the core library - the API allows you to hit URLs or endpoints at scale
* Better integration into MiTM proxies.
